Understanding Compound Interest	Understanding Compound Interest
What is Compound Interest?	What is Compound Interest?
Compound interest is the interest on a loan or deposit that is calculated based on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods. It is a powerful concept in finance and investments because it allows your money to grow exponentially over time.

How does Compound Interest work?	How does Compound Interest work?
Compound interest works by reinvesting the interest earned, rather than paying it out. This means that in each period, the interest earned is added to the principal, so the principal amount grows, and more interest is earned in the next period. The formula for compound interest is:	Compound interest works by reinvesting the interest earned, rather than paying it out.

To use the formula, you first convert the annual interest rate from a percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100. Then, you divide this rate by the number of compounding periods per year. Next, you add 1 to this value, raise the result to the power of the total number of compounding periods (n multiplied by t), and finally multiply by the principal amount (P).

Interest rates are often given as a percentage. To use the formula, you need to convert the percentage to a decimal. To do this, divide the percentage by 100. For example, if the annual interest rate is 5%, convert it to decimal form by dividing 5 by 100, which equals 0.05.	Interest rates are often given as a percentage.
